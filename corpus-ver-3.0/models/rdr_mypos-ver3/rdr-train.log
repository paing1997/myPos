Generate from the gold standard training corpus a lexicon /home/zar/1_pos_model_setup/rdr_mypos-ver3/t1/train1.nopipe.DICT

Extract from the gold standard training corpus a raw text corpus /home/zar/1_pos_model_setup/rdr_mypos-ver3/t1/train1.nopipe.RAW

Perform initially POS tagging on the raw text corpus, to generate /home/zar/1_pos_model_setup/rdr_mypos-ver3/t1/train1.nopipe.INIT

Learn a tree model of rules for POS tagging from /home/zar/1_pos_model_setup/rdr_mypos-ver3/t1/train1.nopipe and /home/zar/1_pos_model_setup/rdr_mypos-ver3/t1/train1.nopipe.INIT
